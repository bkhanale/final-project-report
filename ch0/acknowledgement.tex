\noindent The elation and gratification of this seminar will be incomplete
without mentioning all the people who helped me to make it possible, whose
gratitude and encouragement were invaluable to me. I would like to thank God,
almighty, our supreme guide, for bestowing is blessings upon me in my entire
endeavor. I express my sincere gratitude to  Harshad Mulmuley \& Prof. Tapan
Kumar Sahoo for his guidance and support and students of my class for their
support and suggestions.
