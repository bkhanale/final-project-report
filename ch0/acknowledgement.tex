\noindent The elation and gratification of this report will be incomplete
without mentioning all the people who helped me to make it possible, whose
gratitude and encouragement were invaluable to me. I would like to thank God,
almighty, our supreme guide, for bestowing is blessings upon me in my entire
endeavor. I express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Tapan Kumar Sahoo for
their guidance and support, my managers at Turtlemint for their continuous
feedback and finally students of my class for their support and suggestions.
