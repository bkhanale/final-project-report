\noindent
Turtlemint is an insurance broker company and has to maintain a database for
the information regarding various insurance related parameters including the
information regarding the insurers and their complete dataset. Also every
insurer at Turtlemint has a different type of dataset which makes it harder to
update and maintain the database with latest information. This project aims to
ease up the process of updating and maintaining the database. The project also
focuses on proper data security, user authentication and database integrity.
This project report introduces the process of creating a REST API
service to manage database changes with integrated authentication using Django.
REST is acronym for {\bf{RE}}presentational {\bf{S}}tate {\bf{T}}ransfer.
It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Django is an
open-source Python Web framework that encourages rapid development with a clean
design. By the features of Django and Django REST Framework these updates to
the database are are much simpler and protected.\\
