\noindent
Most of the databases now are shared between different tenants giving it a more
complex architecture. Hence any updates being made to the database have to be
properly authenticated and verified that the changes are for that specific
tenant only. This project report introduces the process of creating a REST API
service to manage database changes with integrated authentication using Django.
REST is acronym for {\bf{RE}}presentational {\bf{S}}tate {\bf{T}}ransfer.
It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Django is an
open-source high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. By the features of Django and Django REST
Framework these updates to the database are are much simpler and protected.
