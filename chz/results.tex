Both of the projects namely, Turtlemint Assistant and MintAcademy are
undergoing active development and will continuously improve over time. Both of
the projects were being worked upon as a part of our internship at Turtlemint.
The primary objective of both of the projects is satisfied and more new
features are being added to the project. Our contribution to the project will
continue until the end of our internship and even after that as long as we're
a part of the company.

The applications ease of the process of a database-driven web application.
Django is the only main framework required for the applications functioning
reducing the number of complexities in the project. Also, Django being Python
bases is easy to understand and promotes faster development. Due to all these
reasons the development of the project was very quick.
